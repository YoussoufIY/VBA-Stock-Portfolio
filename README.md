# VBA-challenge
Sheet contains 3 years of daily stock prices (2018-2020)
Created a script that loops through all of the sheets in the workbook that will calculate:
-the yearly change for each ticker symbol. Color coded to green for positive gains, red for negative and neutral for zero gains
-percentage change
-total stock volume
Also will determine greatest increase in stock price, greatest decrease and greatest volume of stock.
